# Twisted_Trees
Text Based RPG with Races, Classes, Skill Points, and Items!

Twisted Trees is a text based RPG written in Python3 that has different races, classes, and fighting styles. It is run entirely in command prompt or terminal.

Twisted Trees has been my pet project for developing my Python Skills, and started with a bunch of call functions.

It has been the number one project for helping me understand OOP, and I have .

To play: download 'main-rpg.py', 'character.py', 'item.py', and 'story.py'; with these downloaded, run 'main-rpg.py' with python3, and you'll be good to go!

PROGRESS:

Fight Mechanics - complete
Items - partially complete (still need to fix inventory system)
